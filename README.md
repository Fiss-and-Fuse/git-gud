# Git Gud

Git Gud is meant to be an extended and more lightweight version of [learngitbranching.js.org](learngitbranching.js.org).

The goal is to make this project contributor-friendly and able to support
 exercises for every git command out there with minimal additional effort on the contributor end. Specifically, we want to build a guide that anyone can understand, even if they are unfamiliar with coding concepts.
 
This repository is very much under development, and we want your help! One of the best ways to learn about git is to
actually contribute to a project, and what better project than this one!

Some commands you'll want to learn and what they do:
* git gud start
  * Gives you a blank canvas (or repository) you can work on
  * Welcome to git gud
  * Starts you on the first challenge

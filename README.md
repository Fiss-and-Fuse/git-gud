# Git Gud
Git Gud is meant to be an extended and more lightweight version of [learngitbranching.js.org](learngitbranching.js.org).

The goal is to make this project contributor-friendly and able to support
 exercises for every git command out there with minimal additional effort on the contributor end.

This repository is very much under development and is meant to always be as long as people are out there to learn git
and encounter novel situations that they think others should learn about. One of the best ways to learn about git is to
actually contribute to a project, and what better project than this one!

Here are some commands you'll want to use:
* git gud start
* git gud help
* git gud load level1
* git gud load sequence1
* git gud load sequence1 level1
* git gud commit
* git gud commit A
* git gud instructions
* git gud goal
* git gud test
* git gud save
